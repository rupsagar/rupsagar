### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Rupsaagar Chatterjee. I am currently working as an Associate Engineer at Airbus India. I have an M.Tech. in Structural Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, and a Bachelor in Civil from Jadavpur University, both situated in India.

I am currently pursuing a personal project of developing a general-purpose numerical tool with nonlinear capabilities for analysis of continuum mechanics and fracture mechanics problems. I also plan to develop a sophisticated and intuitive graphical user interface for its application.
