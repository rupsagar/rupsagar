### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Rupsaagar Chatterjee. I am currently working as a Project Associate at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. I have a Master of Technology in Structural Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, and a Bachelor of Engineering in Civil from Jadavpur University, both in India. I will be joining as an Associate Engineer in Airframe Division at Airbus Group India Private Limited.

I am currently pursuing a personal interest of developing a powerful general-purpose numerical tool with nonlinear capabilities for analysis of continuum mechanics and fracture mechanics problems. I also plan to develop a sophisticated and very intuitive graphical user interface for the application.
